.SH DESCRIPTION
The Shell provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. It is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.
Generally, a shell is a program that executes other programs in response to text commands.
